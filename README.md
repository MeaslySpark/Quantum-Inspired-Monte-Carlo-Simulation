# Quantum-Inspired-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This project contains Matlab code for solving one and two-dimensional Laplace equations using Quantum inspired Monte Carlo method.
In this project, I have made use of Quantum walks for sampling our target probability distribution.
Quantum walks are quantum analogs of classical random walks.
